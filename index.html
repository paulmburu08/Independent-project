      <p>Photography has been a passion ever since i was a child.I went through primary at Fountain Junior school
		    and high school at <a href="https://www.aquinashigh.sc.ke/"><em>Aquinas High school</em></a>.I later 
			  ended up at <a href="https://www.cuk.ac.ke/"><em>co-operative university</em></a> doing Tourism management
			  where i wanted to incorporate Tourism and Photography.I recently started software development and love it! 
        Although just a beginner,i believe i am going to be <strong>among the best of the best.</strong></p>
